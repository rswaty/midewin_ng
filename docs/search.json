However, some patterns are worth noting:\n\nInterestingly, there has been a broad-scale change from ‘hardwood’ type to more ‘conifer’ types. Likely due primarily to conversion of hardwood to pine for timber production.\nThere has been some conversion from past conifer, past hardwood, past hardwood-conifer, and past grassland to developed and agricultural types, though overall, the forest remains heavily forested.\nAcres of grassland have been dramatically reduced. Almost all of the past 30,000 acres of grassland have been converted to agriculture, exotic, and forested types.\nExotic types now represent roughly 55,000 acres of the forest.\n\nNote: number presented when hovering equals acres."

Succession class E is characterized as closed canopy (&gt;71% canopy cover) wiht a sparse herbaceous understory. As fire has been identified as the most prevalent disturbance on this landscape, this shift is presumably due to lack of fire on the landscape.\nThe ‘Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf Pine-Bluestem Woodland’ community has the most dramatic shift in succession class, with much of the past Succession Class D and C, described as mid to late-seral woodland savannah with pine oak overstory and bluestem grass understory representative of this community, shifting to closed canopy (Succession Class E).\nAll three ecosystems had dramatic reductions in Succession Classes A, B, and C. These succession classes are early and mid development classes, with seedling and sapling trees (Class A) to midstory trees (&lt; 10m tree height) (Class B and C). Overall, this trend suggests that in the past, higher intensity or frequency of disturbance (primarily fire) shifted ecosystems into, and maintained, these earlier development succession classes."

    "text": "Summary\nIn general the Ouachita National Forest, as of 2022, has experienced some interesting changes in natural ecosystems. However, care should be taken when directly comparing past and present maps, as classification systems for present Biophysical Settings have been updated to align with the most current NatureServe (2016) ecosystem descriptions. With this caveat in mind, some patterns are worth noting:\n\nShortleaf pine and oak dominated systems are still the most prevalent vegetation types on the forest, though much of the vegetation types have shifted from “woodland” descriptions to more “forest” descriptions, indicating an increase in canopy cover.\nThe most prevalent past Biophysical Setting, ‘Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf-Pine Bluestem Woodland’ is no longer the most prevalent vegetation type. Large areas of in the central and southeastern portion of the forest appear to have been converted to pasture and plantation, likely due to the low gradient associated with this community.\nSome additional areas that were previously ‘Ozark-Ouachita Dry-Mesic Oak Forest’, ‘Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf Pine-Oak Forest and Woodland’ and ‘Ozark-Ouachita Dry-Mesic Oak Forest’ have been converted to plantation.\nThe southwestern portion of the forest represents the most development, with the majority of the area now converted from ‘West Gulf Coastal Plain Pine-Hardwood Forest’ and ‘Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain Floodplain Systems’ to pasture and plantation.\nThe Ouachita National Forest remains heavily forested, as indicated by the Existing Vegetation Cover and Existing Vegetation Height."
